Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100). The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that help businesses tailor marketing strategies effectively.

Features
Data preprocessing and exploration

Finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Implementing K-Means clustering to group customers

Visualizing clusters with centroids for better insights

Tools & Libraries
Python

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

How to Use

git clone [your-repo-link]
Install required packages (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook or script to reproduce the analysis and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset contains customer information with two key features:

Annual Income (in thousands of dollars)

Spending Score (1-100)

Results
Clear segmentation of customers into meaningful groups
